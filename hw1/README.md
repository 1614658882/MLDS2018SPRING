# MLDS2018SPRING/hw1
There are three Parts in HW1.
# 1. Deep vs Shallow:
* Simulate a funtion.
* Train on actual task using shallow and deep models.
```
cd 
```
# 2. Optimization:
* Observe gradient norm during training.
* What happens when gradient is almost zero?
# 3. Generalization
* Can network fit random labels?
* Number of parameters v.s. Generalization
* Flatness v.s. Generalization
